Most of features are available on the <b>toolbars</b> and in the menus on top of a main window.

<hr>
Use <b>context menu</b> (opens with the right mouse button) to get access to properties of target item or selected item group.

<hr>
Do you remember the bug with placing vines in SMBX? You can clean-up your level from junk NPCs caused by this bug by the menu item:<br>
<b>Tools -&gt;Custom data -&gt;Remove NPC garbage...</b>

<hr>
If you are creating graphics for SMBX, you can use <b>PNG2GIFs</b> tool with drag & drop interface to quickly convert your PNG images into SMBX compatible format which uses GIF images with a bit mask.

<hr>
Do you hear your musics playing too fast or plays buggy?<br>
Be sure that your musics have a sample rate of 44100. If you hear that music plays too fast or buggy - your music file has a non-44100 hz sample rate. You can quickly fix your music file with the menu item:
<b>Tools -&gt;External tools -&gt;Convert audio (SoX)...</b>

<hr>
You can use middle mouse button for advanced convenience!<br>
<ul>
<li>If no selected elements on a map, you will toggle into hand-drag mode</li>
<li>If selected one element, you will switch "placing new" mode of same element</li>
<li>If selected multiple elements, there are will be duplicated to current mouse position relative to left-top corner of selection area</li>
</ul>

<hr>
You have the <b>Overwrite mode</b> which allows you to place new elements over existing ones with removing of them.

<hr>
Did you know that layers and events in a list are movable? Drag items in the list to change order of them!

<hr>
Are your custom images are semi-transparent? That may be happened if your custom images are have non Black & White mask or just having a lazily-made mask.<br>
To quickly fix them you can try:
<ul>
<li>Run <b>Tools -&gt;Custom data -&gt;Fix wrong masks...</b> menuitem when you have opened level or world map with broken graphics</li>
<li>Try to enable <b>View -&gt; Enable GFX-Fix</b> flag in the editor and reload your level with F5 key.</li>
</ul>
In next time use PNG2GIFs tool to create SMBX specific images instead of lazily-made sprites usage.
