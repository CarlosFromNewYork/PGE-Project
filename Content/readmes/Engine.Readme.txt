This is a little test of developing engine part.

What's need to run level play:
==============================================
Preparing:
==============================================
1) Download & unpack PGE Editor (need a libraries)
2) Install any 'full' configuration package into editor
==============================================
Launching:
==============================================
3) Drag any SMBX LVL file or PGE LVLX file and drop them into engine .exe file
   (like you drop file into folder icon) to run engine with opening of dropped file.
----------------------------------------------
4) from 0.0.4 engine have a main menu.
You can copy your levels into worlds folder or into %UserProfile%\.PGE_Project\worlds
or into ~/.PGE_Project/worlds folder and you can play than levels from "Battle game" menu
==============================================

You should be up to date with any configuration packages,
there are in dev-state: I fixing old mistakes, misses, adding new important features which
should be presented in your ini files of each config pack. Else you may get wrongs and more bugs
because wrong config settings.

==============================================
Controlls:
==============================================
