<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PGE Editor </strong>- is a flexible, universal editor for levels, 
world maps and NPC configurations. With them you can create own levels, world 
maps, episodes and even whole games!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Editor have a lots of tools which will help you to create your levels and 
worlds convetient, fast, progressive and <span class="ref_result">qualitative!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
PGE Editor - is a part of developing PGE Project which based on SMBX64 standard 
- a tech stuff of SMBX Engine. PGE Project going to be successof of old SMBX 
Engine to give more freedom of customization and giving able use it more useful 
for creation of any platform games!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interface of PGE Editor have most of features in the toolbar: you can switch 
between sections - separated sub-areas or rooms; place player's start/spawn 
point, take placing of physical environments (water, quicksand); lock or unlock 
items of target type to keep them in safe; show/hide of some toolboxes - helpful 
boxes which contains most of settings of items, section, etc. Also you can copy 
selected items or paste them from clipboard back. PGE Editor have a status bar 
where you can see some difference messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike original SMBX Editor, PGE Editor using multi-selecting concept which 
giving able work with multiple items at one. Instead of classic dragging of each 
item to change their properties, you have able use context menu. You also have 
able to set same properties to multiple items at one! You can copy, you can 
paste your stuff into another level/world, you can undo any junk changes (and 
redo them too). With placing mode you have useful features like line, rectangle, 
flood-fill which help you place items more convenient. With "Overwrite mode" you 
can even replace items on the map without pre-deleting of them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline">PGE Editor unlike original SMBX have no 
bugs which was in the SMBX before:</p>
<p>- you have full freedom with using of decimal values in the npc.txt files 
(they are opening freely and safely)</p>
<p>- you have full freedom to use custom sceneries in range 32-65 on the world 
map with correct saving of file (SMBX crashing when you try to save world map 
with those items).</p>
<p>- you will don't flood with vines or with sceneries when you try to put them 
to map.</p>
<p>- flood-fill is safe, if you was accidental flooded outer space, 
flood-filling process will be aborted after 3 sec. which will give you able undo 
it and fix your wrongs without re-opening of editor.</p>
<p>- you will never get "overflow" message because PGE Editor have more space to 
hold your items. If you try to save level or world into SMBX format, you will be 
noticed about exiding of it's limit which giving you able remove junk items to 
take able open your level in the SMBX correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't like regular item box with categories and filter search, you 
have able use <strong>Tileset Item Box</strong> which giving you tileset box 
which more similar to original SMBX toolbox, but you have special "Custom" tab 
where you have able to make your own tilesets!&nbsp;</p>
